    It seems you haven't yet set up the Extension yet! In order to get the most
    out it, you need to provide your WaniKani access token.

  <p class="oob-message">
    You can get it by going
    <a
      href="https://wanikani.com/settings/personal_access_tokens"
      target="_blank"
      >here</a
    >
    and copying your API key. The default, read-only should do just fine!

    Don't worry, I only use your API token to get some item information from
    WaniKani. It won't affect your progress at all.
